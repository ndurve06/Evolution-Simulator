# Evolution-Simulator
Developed for my A-Level Coursework. Its purpose is to predict the growth of single cell organisms in a gird. Models population growth, mutations and survival. Users can load a tutorial and previous setup and configure genotypes, phenotypes, environments, radiation, nutrients and obstacles to observe real time changes.
